Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze different NBA statistics to better understand players' values. We created a valuation model for evaluating players, using our correlation coefficients of the key statistics vs. win shares. We multiplied each statistic by their coefficient and divided it by the number of stats we used in order to get our own version of the wins they bring their team using the average of multiple statistics. This method proved to be effective, as the top players were the all-stars, with the highest valued player also being named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for both 2016 and 2017. After looking at the top 20 valued players, we examined the top players at each position and at a low salary mark for each position as well. We believe our findings would be useful for an NBA GM in deciding which players to target and carrying out different transactions.
